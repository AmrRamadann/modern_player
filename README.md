## Installation

In your pubspec.yaml file within your Flutter Project add modern_player under dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  modern_player: <latest_version>
```

## Instalation from flutter_vlc_player

### iOS

If you're unable to view media loaded from an external source, you should also add the following:
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```
For more information, or for more granular control over your App Transport Security (ATS) restrictions, you should
[read Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsapptransportsecurity/nsallowsarbitraryloads).

Make sure that following line in `<project root>/ios/Podfile` uncommented:

`platform :ios, '9.0'`

> NOTE: While the Flutter `video_player` is not functional on iOS Simulators, this package (`flutter_vlc_player`) **is**
> fully functional on iOS simulators.

To enable vlc cast functionality for external displays (chromecast), you should also add the following:

```xml
<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>Used to search for chromecast devices</string>
<key>NSBonjourServices</key>
<array>
  <string>_googlecast._tcp</string>
</array>
```

<hr>

### Android
To load media/subitle from an internet source, your app will need the `INTERNET` permission.  
This is done by ensuring your `<project root>/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file contains a `uses-permission`
declaration for `android.permission.INTERNET`:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

As Flutter includes this permission by default, the permission is likely already declared in the file.

Note that if you got "Cleartext HTTP traffic to * is not permitted"
you need to add the `android:usesClearTextTraffic="true"` flag in the AndroidManifest.xml file, or define a new "Network Security Configuration" file. For more information, check https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config

<br>

In order to load media/subtitle from internal device storage, you should put the storage permissions as follows:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```
In some cases you also need to add the `android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"` flag to the Application tag in AndroidManifest.xml file.

After that you can access the media/subtitle file by 

    "/storage/emulated/0/{FilePath}"
    "/sdcard/{FilePath}"

<hr>

#### Android build configuration

1. In `android/app/build.gradle`:
```groovy
android {
    packagingOptions {
       // Fixes duplicate libraries build issue, 
       // when your project uses more than one plugin that depend on C++ libs.
        pickFirst 'lib/**/libc++_shared.so'
    }
   
   buildTypes {
      release {
         minifyEnabled true
         proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile(
                 'proguard-android-optimize.txt'),
                 'proguard-rules.pro'
      }
   }
}
```

2. Create `android/app/proguard-rules.pro`, add the following lines:
```proguard
-keep class org.videolan.libvlc.** { *; }
```
<hr>

#### Android multi-window support

To enable multi-window support in your Android application, you need to make changes to `AndroidManifest.xml`, add the `android:resizeableActivity` key for the main activity, as well as the `android.allow_multiple_resumed_activities` metadata for application:
```xml
<manifest ...>
  <application ...>
    <activity ...
      android:resizeableActivity="true">
      ...
    </activity>
    ...
    <meta-data
      android:name="android.allow_multiple_resumed_activities"
      android:value="true" />
  </application>
</manifest>
```

<br>

## Using it

```dart
import 'package:modern_player/modern_player.dart';

final modernPlayerWidget = SizedBox(
    height: 200,
    child: ModernPlayer.createPlayer(
      qualityOptions: [
        ModernPlayerQualityOptions(
            name: "Default",
            url:
                "https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/videos/butterfly.mp4")
      ],
    ),
  );
```

## Options

Modern player has some option to adjust and theme your controls. By default all button and features are enabled.

To enable disable button, you can add these lines to your `modern_player`

```dart
  controlsOptions: ModernPlayerControlsOptions(
      showControls: true,
      doubleTapToSeek: false,
      showMenu: true,
      showMute: false,
      showBackbutton: false,
      enableVolumeSlider: true,
      enableBrigthnessSlider: true,
      showBottomBar: true)
```
### Theme Customization

To customize theme or colors of your player, you can add these lines to your `controlsOptions`

```dart
  themeOptions: ModernPlayerThemeOptions(
      backgroundColor: Colors.black,
      menuBackgroundColor: Colors.black,
      loadingColor: Colors.white,
      menuIcon: const Icon(
        Icons.settings,
        color: Colors.white,
      ))
```
To customize theme of progress slider, you can add these lines to your `controlsOptions`

```dart
  progressSliderTheme: ModernPlayerProgressSliderTheme(
      activeSliderColor: Colors.blue,
      inactiveSliderColor: Colors.white70,
      bufferSliderColor: Colors.black54,
      thumbColor: Colors.white,
      progressTextStyle: const TextStyle(
          fontWeight: FontWeight.w400,
          color: Colors.white,
          fontSize: 18))
```
